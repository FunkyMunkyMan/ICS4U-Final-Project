# ICS4U-Final-Project
Strategic Toast Injector (STI)
Authors: Jonah Monaghan, Seth Thomson, Matt Godfrey

Game style: 2D side-scrolling shooter

The player is represented on screen by a bird icon, and is continually propelled forwards. 
Toaster blocks will be generated procedurally, forming barriers as the player progresses. 
The player crashing into these barriers at any point will result in a game over, at which point the player will be allowed to begin again. 
The player will be able to fire projectiles in the form of toast, to clear holes in the toaster barriers. 
This will also result in an increase in score. 
The player will be able to move up and down to avoid or shoot the toasters.  
The player’s primary objective is to get the highest score possible, with their score accumulating as they survive the game and clear toasters. 
As the player’s score increases, the toasters that spawn will become increasingly more difficult to dodge and harder to destroy using toast. 
Additionally, the players speed will increase, thus further upping the difficulty. 
The game, as previously mentioned, will end when the user crashes into a toaster. 
They will then be presented the opportunity to retry, or to quit. 
The program exits should the user decide to quit.
